# Increased age heaping in mobile phone surveys conducted in low-income and middle-income countries

Here we provide materials for replicating the visualization below. This figure shows how surveys conducted remotely by mobile phone (MPS) in 6 low-income and middle-income countries in Africa, were frequently affected by higher levels of age heaping than recent household surveys and censuses conducted in-person.

# Data

The data visualized in this figure come from multiple sources, including cross-national survey programs and national surveys and censuses. Access to several of these data sources require prior registration. Instructions and links to registration sites are provided in the [supplementary material of the data visualization](https://github.com/shelleringer/heaping-mps/blob/main/Heaping-methods-12042022sh.docx). In this repository, we include a [summary data set](https://github.com/shelleringer/heaping-mps/blob/main/heaping-series.csv). It contains our estimates of Whipple's index by country, year and source of data. 

# Methods

The methods used to calculate Whipple's index in each of the survey/census data sets analyzed are described in the [supplementary material of the data visualization.](https://github.com/shelleringer/heaping-mps/blob/main/Heaping-methods-12042022sh.docx)

# Code

The [code](https://github.com/shelleringer/heaping-mps/blob/main/heaping_visualization.R) included in this repository allows replicating our data visualization from the summary data set of Whipple's index
