# Increased age heaping in mobile phone surveys conducted in low-income and middle-income countries

Here we provide materials for replicating the visualization below. This figure shows how surveys conducted remotely by mobile phone (MPS) in 6 low-income and middle-income countries in Africa, were frequently affected by higher levels of age heaping than recent household surveys and censuses conducted in-person.

# Data

The data visualized in this figure come from multiple sources, including cross-national survey programs and national surveys and censuses. Access to several of these data sources require prior registration. 

# Methods

The methods used to calculate Whipple's index in each of the survey/census data sets analyzed are described in the [supplementary material of the data visualization.](https://github.com/shelleringer/heaping-mps/files/10148061/Heaping-methods-10122022sh.docx)


# Code

The code included in this repository allows replicating our data visualization from the summary data set of Whipple's index
